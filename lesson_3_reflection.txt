When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when I want to work with a team, collaborate in a open source project, or just to have a backup of my project.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

This helpful to keep our repository under control when we're working in teams, because somebody can update the repository and insert 
changes that we don't want to keep.
